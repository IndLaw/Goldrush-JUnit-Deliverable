# IndLaw-1632-Deliverable-2

	This project helped me understand why testing techniques are important. Before it was something that seemed straightforward but was something I struggled with. After being made to think about writing unit tests for all the tasks in each class, it became clear how to make sure that techniques were testable. I began to make sure that any variables or items I used in the function were carried in so that I could mock them in testing. 
  
	The major issues I faced were coming up with ways to test methods that had no return values. Rather than creating tests along side the code during development, tests were written after the code had been created. There would have been fewer issues testing if making testable code had been at the forefront of my mind during the start of the project. That lead me to attempt to write pure features towards the end of the development cycle.
