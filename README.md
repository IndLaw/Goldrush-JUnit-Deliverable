# Goldrush-JUnit-Deliverable
The major issues I faced were coming up with ways to test methods that had no return values. Rather than creating tests alongside the code during development, tests were written after the code had been created. There would have been fewer issues testing if making testable code had been at the forefront of my mind during the start of the project. That lead me to attempt to write pure features towards the end of the development cycle.
